# gl-projects

This repo contains my graphics projects that are implemented in OpenGL.

It includes a gfx_utils library that provides useful functionality when
implementing graphics techniques. Its core tenet is that the person should
have full control over the actual graphics code while having useful utilities
that can make the work easier.

This library is designed for people who are prototyping and experimenting with 
graphics techniques and is not meant to be a well-designed rendering engine.

## Dependencies

These must be installed on the system for compilation to work:
* GLEW 2.1.0
* GLFW 3.3
